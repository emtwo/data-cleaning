The variable names are self-explanatory and take the following format:
1) They contain either "mean()" or "std()" in them indicating the measurement being represented 
2) They are prepended with 'Average' indicating the variable is an average of either mean() or std()
3) They are appended with "X", "Y", or "Z" denoting the direction of the signal, if one exists
4) The signal itself is in the variable name and is one of the following 17:
